# Microservice (Under Process)....

## Before microservices

  → **Monolithic architecture** : multiple components are combined in single large app.

      example :- Blogging app

  →  Single code base

  → Deployed in single bundle

  → Change in one service then whole app is redeployed

  → Building problem :developer has to communicate

  → Problem in scale (to make big face problem during that time)

  → Cumbersome over time 

### **Reason why we need Microservices** : *To Overcomes such  above problem ;*

### Advantages of **Microservices** :

  → Large apps are divide into small parts

  → Different codebase

  → Each module managed independently (or easily)

  → Different tech stack

### Disadvantages of **Microservices** :

 → **Handling microservices is complex**
