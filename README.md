## Before microservices

  â†’ **Monolithic architecture** : multiple components are combined in single large app.

  â†’ example :- Blogging app refer this ðŸ‘‰[clickMe](https://github.com/ahtishamkhan5678/Blogging_Application_APIs)

  â†’  Single code base

  â†’ Deployed in single bundle

  â†’ Change in one service then whole app is redeployed

  â†’ Building problem :developer has to communicate

  â†’ Problem in scale (to make big face problem during that time)

  â†’ Cumbersome over time 


### **Reason why we need Microservices** : *To Overcomes such  above problem ;*


### Advantages of **Microservices** :

  â†’ Large apps are divide into small parts

  â†’ Different codebase

  â†’ Each module managed independently (or easily)

  â†’ Different tech stack
