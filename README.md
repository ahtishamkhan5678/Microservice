## Before Microservices

   Monolithic architecture
  
            multiple components are combined in single large app.

   example :- Blogging app refer this ðŸ‘‰[clickMe](https://github.com/ahtishamkhan5678/Blogging_Application_APIs)

            â†’ Single code base

            â†’ Deployed in single bundle

            â†’ Change in one service then whole app is redeployed

            â†’ Building problem :developer has to communicate

            â†’ Problem in scale (to make big face problem during that time)

            â†’ Cumbersome over time 


### **Reason why we need Microservices** :

            To Overcomes such  above problem 

### **What is Microservices**
            Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development
            where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
            These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
            Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, 
            enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

### Advantages of **Microservices** :

            â†’ Large apps are divide into small parts

            â†’ Different codebase

            â†’ Each module managed independently (or easily)

            â†’ Different tech stack
